                        I wonder if wines from these regions are more tasty. Interestingly enough, 4 of the 5 top wineries in France 
                        are located in southern France, though at the same latitude as the 3 in norhtern Italy, 
                        maybe the climate is just perfect around this latitude?

                        Interesting! We see that most wines from Italy are made of Primitivo while an overwhelming amount of French wines
                        are Syrah. Both countries produce Cabernet Sauvignon, however it is more prominent in France.

                        It should be noted that only the 500 first pages of Vivino's wine explorer website were scraped, 
                        and that the ordering was based on price. Therefore (as can be seen in the plot and table above), the maximum
                        price is 149 for both countries, and the mean is almost up there as well, meaning the scraping of 500 pages 
                        only reached an upper limit of 149DKK, and that a lot of wines are listed at this price.

                    <p class="lead">
                        Another important factor is the rating of the wines, that is how many points
                        on average (0-5), other users have given the wine. Have a look.

                        It seems all wines are average, lying between 3.2-4.5 for Italian wines and 3.1-4.3 for French wines.
                        People rate a lot of Italian wines 4.1, and 3.7 is also common. For french wines, common ratings are 3.6, 3.8, 3.9 and 4.1. All 
                        in all pretty impressive for wines below 150DKK!

                            Moving on to what we all came for, how the wines are connected based on similarities. 
                            Below we have examined how wines are connected based on their
                            flavours. If a wine
                            has the same flavor profile as another wine (e.g. both have main flavour oak), an
                            edge has been
                            added
                            between the nodes (each node being a wine). In order to futher destinguish and categorize
                            the wines, the
                            nodes have been colored
                            based on the main grape used to produce the wine. An edge is given the color of its' nodes' grape if
                            the two nodes (wines) the edge connects, are produced from the same grape.

                            It seems the graph is split into two main groups, one mainly consisting of wines produced from 
                        Malvasia, Arneis and Trebbiano, and the other mainly consisting of all other wines. Therefore, it makes sense 
                        that the links between the two groups are not any connecting the same grapes.
