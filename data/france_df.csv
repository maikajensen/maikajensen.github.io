Languedoc-Roussillon is the biggest wine producing region in the world, responsible for over 1/3 of France's wine production.

Although the region has been known to produce cheap table wine in the past, many vineyards and cooperatives are replacing lesser quality vines with higher quality wine varieties and production methods.

These light and crisp roses have just the slightest touches of bright berry flavors and can complement a meal perfectly or be delightful on their own.

The dry, refreshing, pink wines of Provence may not be complicated or heady, but they are certainly lovely. These brightly flavored, yet pale colored wines are full of crisp acidity with light touches of tart red berries and citrus fruit.

These wines may not be serious, but you can't drink serious wines all of the time! Current trends are making these wines ridiculously popular, and for good reason.

They are the perfect summer wine and can make any light afternoon meal even better with their liveliness and pretty fruit. These are much lighter than most California roses, but are typically much fresher and sharper.",Pork,Shellfish,red_fruit,tree_fruit,Shiraz/Syrah,Grenache,59.95

Bordeaux is the largest wine producing region in France. It consists of two major areas—the Left and the Right Bank. Both lie in the heart of the Gironde estuary and are further divided by its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers.

When shopping for Bordeaux reds, keep in mind, French wines are all about the region and the blend, not about individual grape varieties. In fact, you will rarely find blend percentages listed on the label.

While Bordeaux is better-known for its reds, or as the British affectionately call them, clarets, its whites are world class too.

White wine production in Bordeaux is rather sparse, as compared with reds, and comprises roughly 11% of overall volume. But don't worry, that's still over 7 million cases of white wine!

As with the reds, Bordeaux Blanc are mostly blends. The most common variety is Sémillon, followed by Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle. Bordeaux is also home to some of the most famous dessert wines in the world, from the renowned Sauternes sub-appellation and Barsac.

The best dry white wines are from the Graves region, and are usually lightly oak aged. White Bordeaux often possess vibrant acidity and elegant citrus notes that lean toward white grapefruit. These brilliant, charming whites are exquisite when paired with scallops, roast chicken with tarragon, asparagus quiche or salads with shaved fennel.

Sauternes owe their characteristic depth and concentration to Botrytis cinerea (or Noble Rot, an infection which causes the grapes to shrivel). The quintessential French pairing with Sauternes is foie gras, or duck paté. Soft-ripened cheeses and desserts like crème brûlée are excellent matches.

Stylistically, they exhibit more nuanced flavors and less up-front fruit. Sophisticated and elegant, they pair well with game meats, roast lamb, or hearty beef stews.

Bordeaux is the largest wine producing region in France. It consists of two major areas—the Left and the Right Bank. Both lie in the heart of the Gironde estuary and are further divided by its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers.

While the Right Bank produces blends that are mostly Merlot dominant, the Left Bank produces blends that are primarily Cabernet Sauvignon dominant.

Bordeaux reds are said to be terroir-driven (if you like French wines, you'll hear this term a lot). Terroir is a concise way to define a specific region based upon the soil, climate, and the collective knowledge of the generations of people who have farmed the land.

When shopping for Bordeaux reds, keep in mind, French wines are all about the region and the blend, not about individual grape varieties. In fact, you will rarely find blend percentages listed on the label.

Collectively, Bordeaux produces 700 million bottles of wine in an average year! While some of the most expensive wines in the world come from Bordeaux, most are every day, affordable table wines.",Beef,Veal,oak,black_fruit,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cabernet Franc,89.0

While Bordeaux is better-known for its reds, or as the British affectionately call them, clarets, its whites are world class too.

White wine production in Bordeaux is rather sparse, as compared with reds, and comprises roughly 11% of overall volume. But don't worry, that's still over 7 million cases of white wine!

As with the reds, Bordeaux Blanc are mostly blends. The most common variety is Sémillon, followed by Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle. Bordeaux is also home to some of the most famous dessert wines in the world, from the renowned Sauternes sub-appellation and Barsac.

The best dry white wines are from the Graves region, and are usually lightly oak aged. White Bordeaux often possess vibrant acidity and elegant citrus notes that lean toward white grapefruit. These brilliant, charming whites are exquisite when paired with scallops, roast chicken with tarragon, asparagus quiche or salads with shaved fennel.

Sauternes owe their characteristic depth and concentration to Botrytis cinerea (or Noble Rot, an infection which causes the grapes to shrivel). The quintessential French pairing with Sauternes is foie gras, or duck paté. Soft-ripened cheeses and desserts like crème brûlée are excellent matches.

While Bordeaux is better-known for its reds, or as the British affectionately call them, clarets, its whites are world class too.

White wine production in Bordeaux is rather sparse, as compared with reds, and comprises roughly 11% of overall volume. But don't worry, that's still over 7 million cases of white wine!

As with the reds, Bordeaux Blanc are mostly blends. The most common variety is Sémillon, followed by Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle. Bordeaux is also home to some of the most famous dessert wines in the world, from the renowned Sauternes sub-appellation and Barsac.

The best dry white wines are from the Graves region, and are usually lightly oak aged. White Bordeaux often possess vibrant acidity and elegant citrus notes that lean toward white grapefruit. These brilliant, charming whites are exquisite when paired with scallops, roast chicken with tarragon, asparagus quiche or salads with shaved fennel.

Sauternes owe their characteristic depth and concentration to Botrytis cinerea (or Noble Rot, an infection which causes the grapes to shrivel). The quintessential French pairing with Sauternes is foie gras, or duck paté. Soft-ripened cheeses and desserts like crème brûlée are excellent matches.

Stylistically, they exhibit more nuanced flavors and less up-front fruit. Sophisticated and elegant, they pair well with game meats, roast lamb, or hearty beef stews.

Bordeaux is the largest wine producing region in France. It consists of two major areas—the Left and the Right Bank. Both lie in the heart of the Gironde estuary and are further divided by its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers.

While the Right Bank produces blends that are mostly Merlot dominant, the Left Bank produces blends that are primarily Cabernet Sauvignon dominant.

Bordeaux reds are said to be terroir-driven (if you like French wines, you'll hear this term a lot). Terroir is a concise way to define a specific region based upon the soil, climate, and the collective knowledge of the generations of people who have farmed the land.

When shopping for Bordeaux reds, keep in mind, French wines are all about the region and the blend, not about individual grape varieties. In fact, you will rarely find blend percentages listed on the label.

Collectively, Bordeaux produces 700 million bottles of wine in an average year! While some of the most expensive wines in the world come from Bordeaux, most are every day, affordable table wines.",Beef,Veal,oak,black_fruit,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cabernet Franc,119.0

As with the reds, Bordeaux Blanc are mostly blends. The most common variety is Sémillon, followed by Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle. Bordeaux is also home to some of the most famous dessert wines in the world, from the renowned Sauternes sub-appellation and Barsac.

The best dry white wines are from the Graves region, and are usually lightly oak aged. White Bordeaux often possess vibrant acidity and elegant citrus notes that lean toward white grapefruit. These brilliant, charming whites are exquisite when paired with scallops, roast chicken with tarragon, asparagus quiche or salads with shaved fennel.

Sauternes owe their characteristic depth and concentration to Botrytis cinerea (or Noble Rot, an infection which causes the grapes to shrivel). The quintessential French pairing with Sauternes is foie gras, or duck paté. Soft-ripened cheeses and desserts like crème brûlée are excellent matches. The sweet wines from Barsac are worth exploring, and tend to be less expensive.",Pork,Vegetarian,tree_fruit,citrus_fruit,Sauvignon Blanc,Sémillon,119.0

While Bordeaux is better-known for its reds, or as the British affectionately call them, clarets, its whites are world class too.

White wine production in Bordeaux is rather sparse, as compared with reds, and comprises roughly 11% of overall volume. But don't worry, that's still over 7 million cases of white wine!

As with the reds, Bordeaux Blanc are mostly blends. The most common variety is Sémillon, followed by Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle. Bordeaux is also home to some of the most famous dessert wines in the world, from the renowned Sauternes sub-appellation and Barsac.

The best dry white wines are from the Graves region, and are usually lightly oak aged. White Bordeaux often possess vibrant acidity and elegant citrus notes that lean toward white grapefruit. These brilliant, charming whites are exquisite when paired with scallops, roast chicken with tarragon, asparagus quiche or salads with shaved fennel.

Sauternes owe their characteristic depth and concentration to Botrytis cinerea (or Noble Rot, an infection which causes the grapes to shrivel). The quintessential French pairing with Sauternes is foie gras, or duck paté. Soft-ripened cheeses and desserts like crème brûlée are excellent matches.

0,André Lenique,Brut Champagne,André Lenique Brut Champagne,N.V.,3.2,77,Champagne,Frankrig,"While there are many sparkling wine regions around the globe, only Champagne from the Champagne appellation in France can be labeled as such.

Champagne has long been the wine of choice to celebrate special occasions, and its reputation as a luxury beverage has been intact since the Romans established vineyards in Reims in the 5th century (that's a really long time ago).

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

Champagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar. The bubbles we love so much are a natural byproduct of this magical secondary fermentation, in the form of carbon dioxide.",Pork,"Rich fish (salmon, tuna etc)",citrus_fruit,tree_fruit,Chardonnay,Pinot Noir,149.0

White Rhônes offer a cacophony of aromas and flavors including ripe apricots, pears, honey, white flowers, citrus, spice and tree nuts.

A Mediterranean climate makes the Southern Rhône Valley one of the warmest wine growing regions in France.

Grape varieties that thrive in the region are well-suited to the hot, humid summers, and Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre are by far the most common plantings.

The vast majority of Rhône wines found on the market are labeled as Côtes du Rhône AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée). Many are excellent and inexpensive, making them one of the most consumer-friendly French wines to explore. Stylistically, they are rich, easy-drinking wines with moderate tannins and alcohol levels that fall between 14-15%.

Châteauneuf-du-Pape is one of the better-known sub-regions of the Southern Rhône, and while the wines can be somewhat expensive, the quality is generally exceptional.

Grenache is by far the predominant grape found in Châteauneuf-du-Pape blends, and lends jammy red and black fruit notes along with flavors of earth, leather and spice and dried herbs.

The Southern Rhône also produces white wines, though in much smaller portion, typically these are made from Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier.

A Mediterranean climate makes the Southern Rhône Valley one of the warmest wine growing regions in France.

Grape varieties that thrive in the region are well-suited to the hot, humid summers, and Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre are by far the most common plantings.

The vast majority of Rhône wines found on the market are labeled as Côtes du Rhône AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée). Many are excellent and inexpensive, making them one of the most consumer-friendly French wines to explore. Stylistically, they are rich, easy-drinking wines with moderate tannins and alcohol levels that fall between 14-15%.

Châteauneuf-du-Pape is one of the better-known sub-regions of the Southern Rhône, and while the wines can be somewhat expensive, the quality is generally exceptional.

Grenache is by far the predominant grape found in Châteauneuf-du-Pape blends, and lends jammy red and black fruit notes along with flavors of earth, leather and spice and dried herbs.

The Southern Rhône also produces white wines, though in much smaller portion, typically these are made from Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier.

A Mediterranean climate makes the Southern Rhône Valley one of the warmest wine growing regions in France.

Grape varieties that thrive in the region are well-suited to the hot, humid summers, and Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre are by far the most common plantings.

The vast majority of Rhône wines found on the market are labeled as Côtes du Rhône AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée). Many are excellent and inexpensive, making them one of the most consumer-friendly French wines to explore. Stylistically, they are rich, easy-drinking wines with moderate tannins and alcohol levels that fall between 14-15%.

Châteauneuf-du-Pape is one of the better-known sub-regions of the Southern Rhône, and while the wines can be somewhat expensive, the quality is generally exceptional.

Grenache is by far the predominant grape found in Châteauneuf-du-Pape blends, and lends jammy red and black fruit notes along with flavors of earth, leather and spice and dried herbs.

The Southern Rhône also produces white wines, though in much smaller portion, typically these are made from Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier.

A Mediterranean climate makes the Southern Rhône Valley one of the warmest wine growing regions in France.

Grape varieties that thrive in the region are well-suited to the hot, humid summers, and Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre are by far the most common plantings.

The vast majority of Rhône wines found on the market are labeled as Côtes du Rhône AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée). Many are excellent and inexpensive, making them one of the most consumer-friendly French wines to explore. Stylistically, they are rich, easy-drinking wines with moderate tannins and alcohol levels that fall between 14-15%.

Châteauneuf-du-Pape is one of the better-known sub-regions of the Southern Rhône, and while the wines can be somewhat expensive, the quality is generally exceptional.

Grenache is by far the predominant grape found in Châteauneuf-du-Pape blends, and lends jammy red and black fruit notes along with flavors of earth, leather and spice and dried herbs.
