Fiano and Greco are the two big white varietals in Campania and Basilicata, while Sicily has become known for their Bianco d'Alcamo, a dry wine made from the Marsala grape.

Southern Italy's reputation has taken a beating in recent years as they have become known for producing bulk wine that they can't sell, and the reputation seems to endure despite some lovely wine coming from Sicily, Campania and Basilicata.

Fiano tends to be a wonderfully creamy white wine with lots of green apple skin and pear. Greco, arguably Campania's flagship white grape, is a lot crisper, and typically has an abundance of minerality, lemon notes and pear.

Their medium body and complex flavor profile make these wines a great pairing with a wide range of foods such as grilled meats, hearty pasta and strong cheeses.

Ripasso della Valpolicella is a red wine from the Veneto region of Italy. The wine is produced by putting Valpolicella Classico under a second fermentation by adding the skins remaining from Amarone and Recioto production.

This winemaking process imparts additional complexity, tannin, body, and slightly higher alcohol to the wine. Both the body and price point of this wine are somewhere between a Valpolicella Classico and a true Amarone.

Ripasso wines are more approachable on both the palette and the wallet! They retail at far more accessible price points than true Amarone- generally in the $15-$25 price range.

Ripasso della Valpolicella is a wine based on the Corvina grape, with the addition of Rondinella and Molinara rounding out the blend.

While the red wines in Chianti are the most recognizable in Central Italy, the “Super Tuscan” wines get the most attention from critics.

The wines of Central Italy are big in flavor and popularity. This area is known for blending the most famous Italian grape Sangiovese with Cabernet Sauvignon, the most famous grape from France.

The cult-following “Super Tuscans” and the robust Brunello wines also come from this area, as well as the very fine Vino Nobile di Montepulciano.

Sangiovese is the most famous grape from Italy, and its home in Chianti is the focus of Central Italy. This classic style is much less fruity than the red wines of California and a little bit lighter than Cabernet Sauvignon.

In Amarone, the grapes are dried before pressing giving the wine higher alcohol and body. The dark dessert-like fruit is complemented with strong acidity and just a touch of bitterness that makes this wine very sensual and often expensive.

Old World wines tend to be far less about fruit-forward  flavors, and more about the effect that the climate, soil, and adjacently growing flora (terroir) have on the grapes during their growth.

The most widely recognizable varietal is Pinot Grigio which is very rustic, medium-bodied, with medium to high acidity. Chardonnay seems to grow anywhere grapes can grow; although Italian varieties are not normally coveted quality.

Gewürztraminer usually makes us think of Germany, but it's also thriving in Northern Italy. The warmer climate imparts a little less sugar and little more acidity than its German cousin.

This winemaking process imparts additional complexity, tannin, body, and slightly higher alcohol to the wine. Both the body and price point of this wine are somewhere between a Valpolicella Classico and a true Amarone.

The most widely recognizable varietal is Pinot Grigio which is very rustic, medium-bodied, with medium to high acidity. Chardonnay seems to grow anywhere grapes can grow; although Italian varieties are not normally coveted quality.

Gewürztraminer usually makes us think of Germany, but it's also thriving in Northern Italy. The warmer climate imparts a little less sugar and little more acidity than its German cousin.

Nebbiolo produces some of the most exclusive and expensive red wines in Italy, including Barolo and Barbaresco. However, these sought after wines come with a hefty price tag.

It is produced primarily from the Corvina grape. Amarone is characterized by ripe, bold flavors.

Directly after harvest, the grapes are air dried through a process called “appassimento”, which allows them to shrivel into raisins. This concentrates the sugar and flavors in the grapes, producing a distinctive and full-bodied wine well-suited to aging.

It is often said that you can safely forget an Amarone in your wine cellar. Even average Amarones can be aged for 10-15 years. Depending on the vintage and aging technique, wines of exceptional quality can be enjoyed up to 30-50 years after bottling!

In wine, time equals money. The aging process, manual labor, and prime grape-growing real estate mean that Amarone is often quite expensive. Bottles of this iconic wine generally start at $50-$60, but the sky's the limit when it comes to price.

Despite its iconic status, Amarone only received DOCG recognition as recently as 2009.

The cult-following “Super Tuscans” and the robust Brunello wines also come from this area, as well as the very fine Vino Nobile di Montepulciano.

Sangiovese is the most famous grape from Italy, and its home in Chianti is the focus of Central Italy. This classic style is much less fruity than the red wines of California and a little bit lighter than Cabernet Sauvignon.

Old World wines tend to be far less about fruit-forward  flavors, and more about the effect that the climate, soil, and adjacently growing flora (terroir) have on the grapes during their growth.

The most widely recognizable varietal is Pinot Grigio which is very rustic, medium-bodied, with medium to high acidity. Chardonnay seems to grow anywhere grapes can grow; although Italian varieties are not normally coveted quality.

Gewürztraminer usually makes us think of Germany, but it's also thriving in Northern Italy. The warmer climate imparts a little less sugar and little more acidity than its German cousin.

Chianti is a red wine that comes from Tuscany, but can contain small amounts of white grapes during blending. This is not the case with Chianti Classico, which must be solely made from red Sangiovese grapes.

Chianti is not considered to age well, and loses steam quickly.  Find the youngest bottle you can to get the most out of its vibrance.

Chianti is a red wine that comes from Tuscany, but can contain small amounts of white grapes during blending. This is not the case with Chianti Classico, which must be solely made from red Sangiovese grapes.

Chianti is not considered to age well, and loses steam quickly.  Find the youngest bottle you can to get the most out of its vibrance.

Chianti is a red wine that comes from Tuscany, but can contain small amounts of white grapes during blending. This is not the case with Chianti Classico, which must be solely made from red Sangiovese grapes.

Chianti is not considered to age well, and loses steam quickly.  Find the youngest bottle you can to get the most out of its vibrance.

Winemakers have spent the last couple of decades trying to change the old image of Chianti: Wine bottles in wicker basket, interestingly also called fiascoes. They've done so by  by producing very nice wines through state of the art growing and fermentation techniques.

Chianti is a red wine that comes from Tuscany, but can contain small amounts of white grapes during blending. This is not the case with Chianti Classico, which must be solely made from red Sangiovese grapes.

Chianti is not considered to age well, and loses steam quickly.  Find the youngest bottle you can to get the most out of its vibrance.

Chianti is a red wine that comes from Tuscany, but can contain small amounts of white grapes during blending. This is not the case with Chianti Classico, which must be solely made from red Sangiovese grapes.

Chianti is not considered to age well, and loses steam quickly.  Find the youngest bottle you can to get the most out of its vibrance.

Chianti is a red wine that comes from Tuscany, but can contain small amounts of white grapes during blending. This is not the case with Chianti Classico, which must be solely made from red Sangiovese grapes.

Chianti is not considered to age well, and loses steam quickly.  Find the youngest bottle you can to get the most out of its vibrance.

Chianti is a red wine that comes from Tuscany, but can contain small amounts of white grapes during blending. This is not the case with Chianti Classico, which must be solely made from red Sangiovese grapes.

Chianti is not considered to age well, and loses steam quickly.  Find the youngest bottle you can to get the most out of its vibrance.
